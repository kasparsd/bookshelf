# Goodreads Shelves for WordPress

Use the following shortcode to display your [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) bookshelves:

	[goodshelves user="USERID" shelf="SHELF"]

where `USERID` is your user ID (required) and `SHELF` is the name of the shelf to display (optional).


## How it Works

- Uses the [public Atom feeds]() instead of the Goodreads API. Your profile _must be public_ for this to work!

- All responses are cached for 12 hours by default.
